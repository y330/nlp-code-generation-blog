Neural network-based coding tools are unlikely to replace human coders anytime soon. To understand why, consider the limitations inherent in primary ways in which these tools are used.

To begin, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) programs designed to detect bugs in human-created code are extremely useful, but only to a point.

Second, tools like Aroma and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model can generate simple pieces of code from natural language descriptions, but only with human guidance.

However, GitHub Copilot, a new NLP source code generator developed by GitHub and OpenAI shows highly impressive results, and I say this with first hand experience using the tool. Copilot seems to be the direction the future.
