There are numerous applications for automatic code generation that may be implemented in the future. One is to train human developers in a much more flexible, efficient, and targeted manner than is currently possible in our educational system, using the AI coding tools. Automated recommendation systems, for example, could be used to teach programming security to beginners by providing detailed guidance on securing real-life systems as they are coded.

Second, AIs are showing great promise in terms of tracking human coders' activities and helping them work more efficiently.
