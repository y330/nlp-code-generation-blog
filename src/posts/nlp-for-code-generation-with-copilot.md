_Copilot_

As we established earlier, NLP for code generation can fundamentally increase development speed for software developers. Copilot, a beta AI code generation tool that can be used for free seems to add creativity to code generation. You can add code comments(i.e., instruct the computer on how the program will run in plain english or coding challenges) and the Copilot tool will generate full on solutions to these problems. This essentially gets rid of the time wasted developing unnecessary code. Copilot can be used through a free extension for Visual Studio Code, a cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft, but only a select number of users are allowed access as it is in beta.

From a software developer‚Äôs perspective, Copilot‚Äôs benefits come from this: you don‚Äôt have to worry about writing unnecessary lines of code for your machine learning task. It already has the solution prepared and coded for you. With some programming knowledge on top of that, it can be turned into something more advanced than an ordinary line of code.

The applications for this are endless, ranging from training the machine to do other tasks to building other AI Tools. This can be further developed to have a sort of ‚ÄúGenerative‚Äù mode, where the machine is taught the process of creating the code itself.

_Copilot in action_

I personally use Copilot to generate JavaScript in web development, as I never learned JavaScript formally. Instead of searching up syntax and code when facing problems, I can write a comment and use Github Copilot to generate the code for me. This is both an educational experience and a productivity booster, and potentially could be incorporated into computer science education. Since Copilot generates code from comments, it forces developers to be articulate in their comments, and thus it will help them build their communication skills, which overall will enhance the computer science community. However, one should not rely on the technology, as they will get lazy.
